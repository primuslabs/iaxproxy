--- SECURITY ------------------------------------------------------------------

  It is imperative that you read and fully understand the contents of
the security information document before you attempt to configure and run
an IAXProxy server.  Please view our website for details.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--- WHAT IS IAXPROXY ? --------------------------------------------------------

IAXProxy is an open source IAX2 to SIP Back-to-back Protocol Adapter (B2BPA) based originally off the Asterisk PBX.

The goal of this project is to provide highly scalable system which allows anyone to seamlessly integrate IAX2 based endpoints into a SIP based network.  The software is designed to run on commodity hardware and scale linearly while maintaining a single provisioning interface to the entire system.

To achieve this, IAXProxy relies on proven technologies:

Redis - an open-source, networked, in-memory, key-value data store with optional durability.
Restlet - a lightweight, comprehensive, open source REST framework for Java.
Asterisk - IAXProxy utilizes the proven IAX and SIP protocol stacks from Asterisk

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--- SUPPORTED OPERATING SYSTEMS -----------------------------------------------

--- Linux
  The IAXProxy is developed and tested primarily on the GNU/Linux operating system, and is supported on every major GNU/Linux
distribution.

--- Others
  IAXProxy has also been tested on OpenBSD 5.2 



-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--- NEW INSTALLATIONS ---------------------------------------------------------

  Ensure that your system contains a compatible compiler and development
libraries.  IAXProxy requires either the GNU Compiler Collection (GCC) version
3.0 or higher, or a compiler that supports the C99 specification and some of
the gcc language extensions.  In addition, your system needs to have the C
library headers available, and the headers and libraries for ncurses.

  There are many modules that have additional dependencies.  To see what
libraries are being looked for, see ./configure --help, or run
"make menuselect" to view the dependencies for specific modules.

  On many distributions, these dependencies are installed by packages with names
like 'glibc-devel', 'ncurses-devel', 'openssl-devel' and 'zlib-devel' 
or similar.

  So, let's proceed:

1) Read this README file.

  There are more documents than this one in the doc/ directory.  You may also
want to check the configuration files that contain examples and reference
guides. They are all in the configs/ directory.

2) Run "./configure"

  Execute the configure script to guess values for system-dependent
variables used during compilation.

3) Run "make"

  Assuming the build completes successfully:

4) Run "make install"

  If this is your first time working with IAXProxy, you may wish to install
the sample PBX, with demonstration extensions, etc.  If so, run:

5) "make samples"

  Doing so will overwrite any existing configuration files you have installed.

  Finally, you can launch IAXProxy in the foreground mode (not a daemon) with:

# iaxproxy -vvvc

  You'll see a bunch of verbose messages fly by your screen IAXProxy
initializes (that's the "very very verbose" mode).  When it's ready, if
you specified the "c" then you'll get a command line console, that looks
like this:

*CLI>

  You can type "core show help" at any time to get help with the system.  For help
with a specific command, type "core show help <command>".  

  Feel free to look over the configuration files in /etc/iaxproxy

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--- ABOUT CONFIGURATION FILES -------------------------------------------------

  All IAXProxy configuration files share the same format as Asterisk - please 
refer to the Asterisk documentation for details.
